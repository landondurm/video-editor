# Default Overlay Style — THE default graphics pass

**This is what "do a graphics pass" means unless you name something else.** Modern, blue, clean
UI cards that pop up **over** the footage. Nothing full-frame. Nothing bespoke. A ~30-minute pass,
not a production.

Locked 2026-08-05 after a real job overran (1h40m of full-frame illustrated
collage scenes when the ask was "a couple of overlays, maybe some text").

- Craft layer still applies: [`motion-craft.md`](motion-craft.md) — restraint, no pure white, no gloss.
- Render mechanics: [`../workflows/incremental-graphics.md`](../workflows/incremental-graphics.md).
- This doc is the **visual language + the scope contract**. The scope half is the important half.

## 🔒 SCOPE — the part that was missing

| | Default (this doc) | Only when you say so |
|---|---|---|
| **Coverage** | overlay cards over your face | full-frame takeovers, background replacement |
| **Count** | **4–7 graphics** for an intro/section | 15+ |
| **Art** | composed from the 6 templates below | bespoke SVG illustration, characters, props, scenes |
| **Motion** | one in/out per card | per-graphic custom motion systems, tracked/baked paths |
| **Look** | this doc | [`vox-collage-style.md`](vox-collage-style.md), [`liquid-glass-style.md`](liquid-glass-style.md) takeovers |
| **Budget** | **~30 min** end to end | as long as it takes |

**Your face is never hidden.** Cards live in a callout zone beside/below you — if a graphic would
cover your face, it's the wrong graphic. **Zero seconds of full-frame** is the default; any full-frame
beat is a question to ask at plan time (state the total second-count and get a yes), never an
assumption.

**If a beat seems to want more than a card can carry, say so in one line and keep it a card.**
Overrunning the scope to make one beat better is the exact failure this doc exists to stop.

## 🔒 CONSTANTS

### Colors — DARK blue tech UI
Locked 2026-08-05 on your call ("modern tech UI look, dark blue palette, our dark blue grid
background"). This is the brand's signature grid **inverted to navy** — not the bright frosted
panels the long-form preset uses.

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#060d24` | deep navy field (full-frame comps only) |
| `--line` | `rgba(74,124,255,0.16)` | grid lines, 100px cells |
| `--royal` | `#1e48ff` | hero accent, meter fills |
| `--sky` | `#57c9f0` | secondary accent, status furniture |
| `--txt` | `#e8f0ff` | primary text — **off-white, never pure `#fff`** |
| `--muted` | `#8fa6d4` | eyebrows, labels, subs |
| `--green` | `#2ff58a` | **reserved** — a genuine "free"/unlocked payoff, nothing else |
| `--red` | `#ff4d5e` | the strike-through / negation accent |

One accent per card. Green is not decoration: it marks the single beat where something is free or
unlocked, the same way yellow is rationed in the collage preset.

### Font — Inter
`assets/fonts/Inter-{Black,Bold,Regular}.otf` → copy into the job's `assets/fonts/` and
`@font-face` (the headless render needs the file embedded, a system name silently falls back).
Headline = Black, mixed case, `letter-spacing:-1.5px`. Eyebrow label = Bold, uppercase, 23px tracking
`+3.4px`, `--muted` (the `.eyebrow` CSS below is the lock). Body = Regular, `--muted`.

### THE panel — one primitive, everything is built from it
A **solid UI surface**, not translucent glass: opaque enough to read over bright studio footage,
with a royal rim + drop shadow so it sits *on* the frame instead of floating in it.
```css
.panel{position:absolute;background:linear-gradient(160deg,#12224e 0%,#0a1435 100%);
  border:2px solid rgba(96,146,255,0.42);border-radius:22px;
  box-shadow:0 26px 60px rgba(2,7,24,0.72), 0 0 0 1px rgba(6,13,36,0.85),
             inset 0 2px 0 rgba(140,180,255,0.22);}
.panel.hi{border-color:rgba(47,245,138,0.55);      /* the payoff state */
  box-shadow:0 26px 60px rgba(2,7,24,0.72), 0 0 44px rgba(47,245,138,0.30);}
.eyebrow{font-weight:700;font-size:23px;letter-spacing:3.4px;text-transform:uppercase;color:var(--muted);}
.head{font-weight:900;letter-spacing:-1.6px;color:var(--txt);line-height:1;}
```
Plus the small furniture that sells "tech panel" rather than "text box": a glowing status `.dot`,
a hairline `.rule`, segmented meters, bar charts. Use one or two, never all of them.

⚠️ **The panel must read on its OWN fill — `backdrop-filter` does nothing here.** These render as
isolated alpha `.mov`s with no backdrop behind them, so a blur-the-background panel comes out
transparent and reads as a floating text ghost over the footage. Opacity in the gradient, never
`backdrop-filter`.

⚠️ **Glow = stacked blurred duplicates, never `text-shadow`.** Four copies of the same text at
falling blur/opacity (56px → 22px → 7px → sharp) is what spills real light onto the frame;
`text-shadow` at any strength stays a flat sticker halo.

### Placement — 16:9, 1920×1080

| Zone | Box | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Callout L** | x 120 · y 150 · w 620 · max-h 560 | you're framed right of centre |
| **Callout R** | x 1180 · y 150 · w 620 · max-h 560 | you're framed left of centre |
| **Lower-third** | x 120 · y 780 · w 900 · h 170 | names, labels, one-line context |

Pick the side **away from your head** — check one frame of the beat, don't guess. Everything stays
inside title-safe (192 H / 108 V) and above the bottom ~110 px hover-scrubber strip
([`../workflows/long-form.md`](../workflows/long-form.md)).

**9:16 short-form:** same card, same tokens; cards sit in the top half (y 200→960) and obey the
200/300 px safe bands. Everything else in this doc is unchanged.

## 🎨 THE SIX TEMPLATES — compose, never invent

Every graphic is one of these. If a beat doesn't fit one, it probably doesn't need a graphic.

1. **Label card** — eyebrow + 2–5 word headline, one word in `--royal`. The workhorse.
2. **Stat card** — big number (Black, 96px, `--royal`) + a `--muted` label under it.
3. **List card** — eyebrow + **max 3** rows, each a small royal chip/check + 2–4 words. Rows stamp in
   sequence, 4 frames apart.
4. **Compare pair** — two stacked mini-cards, the second with a `--royal` border = the winner.
5. **Lower-third** — a name/label bar in the lower-third box, slides in from the left edge.
6. **Annotation** — a royal arrow/underline/circle drawn onto something already on screen.

No mascots, no characters, no illustrated scenes, no props, no paper/halftone/collage texture, no
gloss, no glow, no 3D. Those are other presets.

## Motion — stepped, one move in, one move out

**Posterized, not smooth** (your call — keep it): every move quantizes onto a 3-frame grid via
`ease: steps(n)` where `n = frames/3`. At 29.97 that reads as ~10fps stepped motion, which is what
stops it looking like a default template fade.

- **In:** fade `0 → 1` + slide 20–28 px, 5–7 frames, stepped.
- **Hold:** static. Sequenced elements stamp 2–6 frames apart, entrance only.
- **Out:** fade `1 → 0` + drift, 6–8 frames, stepped.
- Hard-kill every element at its end (`tl.set('#id',{opacity:0}, end)`) or it pops / lints red.
- One paused GSAP timeline, absolute times, no `Math.random` — deterministic so seeks are frame-exact.
- **Author in frames** (`F(n) = n*1001/30000` at 29.97), so stamps land on the real frame grid.

⚠️ **Never drive text from a tween's `onUpdate`.** It does not fire on `seek()` of a paused
timeline (measured 2026-08-05: the value interpolates correctly, the callback never runs), and the
renderer advances by seeking frame to frame — so an onUpdate counter renders **frozen on its first
value** while looking perfect in a scrub. Emit counts as discrete `tl.set(sel,{innerText:...})`
calls on the step grid instead, which is the posterized look anyway.

That's the whole motion vocabulary. No tracked paths, no baked per-frame motion, no physics — a
basic pass is *not* where that effort goes.

## Build

Same generated-composition mechanics as every other look — a per-job `build.py` under
`projects/<job>/hf-graphics/` emitting one comp per card, rendered to alpha ProRes 4444 and placed on
V2 of the editing app's timeline. At 4–7 short overlay cards there are **no shared-timeline chains and
no part-splitting**: each card is its own independent comp, so a tweak re-renders one ~2s comp.

Author the harness fresh under `projects/<job>/hf-graphics/` from the Build pattern above: a `build.py` emitting one comp per card, plus `render-part.sh` / `render-all.sh` (no sample project ships). **Probe the comp in the browser before spending a render** — recipe in
[`../workflows/incremental-graphics.md`](../workflows/incremental-graphics.md).
